## Introduction

With ChatGPT having been unleashed on the world just a few months ago, it has led to many educators scrambling to try to mitigate the use of ChatGPT in essays and school work.&#x20;

This has led to cities like New York and my own educational institution to block ChatGPT on the network from use. Which at the end of the day is useless as students can use their own devices and home networks to make use of ChatGPT, or even simpler, use VPNs.

But is it really necessary to block and mitigate ChatGPT-written work in educational institutions? Is it a useless endeavor for educational institutions to try so hard to block ChatGPT if they implemented the latest research in education instead of trying to follow a century old system?

Remember that when calculators were first made commercially viable for everyone, educators tried stopping calculators from being used in math tests, but now they're used in high-school math tests nearly every day. Perhaps artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has the potential to be implemented in our education.

## My Experience

Before I answer the above statements I posed, I'll share what my experience as a high-school student has been like with ChatGPT and other artificial intelligences so that you may understand where I am coming from, my reader.

When ChatGPT was released and educators talked about banning ChatGPT, it got me curious about what legitimate use cases did ChatGPT have as a student. So I started using it in early January on a few assignments, and I was pretty surprised with the results. Among my first few use cases was generating opening sentences for my essays by asking it to briefly answer the assignment's requirements and then writing my own response.&#x20;

I realized that with the answers it produced, ChatGPT had the potential to be used as a search engine after having used it on one or two essays. Which is what I pivoted to using the tool as. A few examples included asking it what scientists have contributed to the theory of gravity and what kind of chemicals I would need for a chemical reaction to happen. In both cases, I used the responses it gave to search for an article or website I could use to further read on the assignment and validate what ChatGPT wrote was correct. I wrote down the information it gave and the information I found using external sources in my own words.

ChatGPT sometimes wrote incorrect answers, for example, it gave the dates for the wrong event. That is why I make sure to double-check the answers it gives with external sources.

As of this moment, I can't log into ChatGPT with a browser. Though I can use it with the macOS Menu Bar application, I cannot access my previous chats.
