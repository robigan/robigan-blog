With ChatGPT having been unleashed on the world just a few months ago, it has led to many educators scrambling to try to mitigate the use of ChatGPT in essays and school work.&#x20;

This has led to cities like New York and my own educational institution to block ChatGPT on the network from use. Which at the end of the day is useless as students can use their own devices and home networks to make use of ChatGPT, or even simpler, use VPNs.

But is it really necessary to block and mitigate ChatGPT-written work in educational institutions? Is it a useless endeavor for educational institutions to try so hard to block ChatGPT if they implemented the latest research in education instead of trying to follow a century old system?

Remember that when calculators were first made commercially viable for everyone, educators tried stopping calculators from being used in math tests, but now they're used in high-school math tests nearly every day. Perhaps artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has the potential to be implemented in our education.
