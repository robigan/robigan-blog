## Introduction

With ChatGPT having been unleashed on the world just a few months ago, it has led to many educators scrambling to try to mitigate the use of ChatGPT in essays and school work.&#x20;

This has led to cities like New York and my own educational institution to block ChatGPT on the network from use. Which at the end of the day is useless as students can use their own devices and home networks to make use of ChatGPT, or even simpler, use VPNs.

But is it really necessary to block and mitigate ChatGPT-written work in educational institutions? Is it a useless endeavor for educational institutions to try so hard to block ChatGPT if they implemented the latest research in education instead of trying to follow a century old system?

Remember that when calculators were first made commercially viable for everyone, educators tried stopping calculators from being used in math tests, but now they're used in high-school math tests nearly every day. Perhaps artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has the potential to be implemented in our education.

## My Experience

Before I answer the above statements I posed, I'll share what my experience as a high-school student has been like with ChatGPT and other artificial intelligences so that you may understand where I am coming from, my reader.

I have had access to GPT-3 and the OpenAI API playground back in April 2021 when after having waited for more than 6mo since I had put my application in I received beta access. At the time, my exams were coming close, and I had decided to try using GPT-3 to produce some work for me. It took some tweaking with the prompt and the various variables that you could change to get a different response, but it more or less had worked, and I was satisfied with it.&#x20;

Skipping to this January, when ChatGPT was released and educators talked about banning ChatGPT, it got me curious about what legitimate use cases did ChatGPT have as a student. So I started using it in early January on a few assignments, and I was pretty surprised, among my first few use cases was generating opening sentences for my essays by asking it to briefly answer the assignment's requirements. I realized that with the answers it produced, ChatGPT had the potential to be used as a search engine after having used it on one or two essays. Which is what I pivoted using the tool as.

As of this moment, I can't log into ChatGPT with a browser. Though I can use it with the macOS Menu Bar application, I cannot access my previous chats.
