## Introduction

With ChatGPT having been unleashed on the world just a few months ago, it has led to many educators scrambling to try to mitigate the use of ChatGPT in essays and school work.&#x20;

This has led to cities like New York and my own educational institution to block ChatGPT on the network from use. Which at the end of the day is useless as students can use their own devices and home networks to make use of ChatGPT, or even simpler, use VPNs.

But is it really necessary to block and mitigate ChatGPT-written work in educational institutions? Is it a useless endeavor for educational institutions to try so hard to block ChatGPT if they implemented the latest research in education instead of trying to follow a century old system?

Remember that when calculators were first made commercially viable for everyone, educators tried stopping calculators from being used in math tests, but now they're used in high-school math tests nearly every day. Perhaps artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has the potential to be implemented in our education.

## My Experience

Before I answer the above statements I posed, I'll share what my experience as a high-school student has been like with ChatGPT and other artificial intelligences so that you may understand where I am coming from, my reader.

When ChatGPT was released and educators talked about banning ChatGPT, it got me curious about what legitimate use cases did ChatGPT have as a student. So I started using it in early January on a few assignments, and I was pretty surprised with the results. Among my first few use cases was generating opening sentences for my essays by asking it to briefly answer the assignment's requirements and then writing my own response.&#x20;

I realized that with the answers it produced, ChatGPT had the potential to be used as a search engine after having used it on one or two essays. Which is what I pivoted to using the tool as. A few examples included asking it what scientists have contributed to the theory of gravity and what kind of chemicals I would need for a chemical reaction to happen. In both cases, I used the responses it gave to search for an article or website I could use to further read on the assignment and validate what ChatGPT wrote was correct. I wrote down the information it gave and the information I found using external sources in my own words.

ChatGPT sometimes wrote incorrect answers, for example, it gave the dates for the wrong event. That is why I make sure to double-check the answers it gives with external sources.

As of this moment, I can't log into ChatGPT with a browser. Though I can use it with the macOS Menu Bar application, I cannot access my previous chats.

## What if we didn't need to repress ChatGPT?

In current educational institutions, ChatGPT has been disrupting the system by being able to write extensive segments of text which mimic the language of a high school student. Gaining the student who submitted the ChatGPT written work a high mark for little to no effort. This has prompted educators to detect for ChatGPT written work to prevent students from gaining high marks with little effort. Which is a large effort for the educators and all other staff to try to block it.

This is where I would like to propose an alternate idea on how we should educate that ChatGPT in its current state cannot disrupt. That would be that instead of having educational institutions trying to teach students random information and try to get them to cram that information in. Why not teach the new generation the basics, teach them the thinking patterns required for learning such that they can learn for themselves, and let them learn the rest. Rather, teachers shouldn't dictate what a student learns, but should rather guide them to learn what they want to learn.

Teaching our new generation how to think such that they have the intrinsic will to learn on their own allows them to make full use of an artificial intelligence's powers and educate themselves from it. This avoids the whole issue of mindlessly typing in information to meet a deadline and not benefitting any knowledge from it because they want to learn.

## What does this mean for AI if it constantly evolves?

Artificial Intelligence is constantly evolving, it's constantly learning from what you give it. ChatGPT at the time of writing can write at the level of a high school student, and not too many days ago, it [wrote a job interview and made the top candidates list](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-written-application-got-shortlisted-for-interview-recruiters-2023-1). So it won't be long until it starts writing at the same level a university student does, which by that point the issue won't only be in High/Middle Schools (or Primary School if you're smart enough), but also at a university level. Disrupting the educational field even more.
